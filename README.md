# Deploy a model in the cloud

## Problem Definition

The goal here is to study the feasibility of developing a mobile app that would allow users to take a photo of a fruit and obtain information about that fruit. The development of the app comes with with the necessity to build a first version of a Big Data architecture.

The steps are :

- Feature extraction from images
- Model development
- Big Data architecture building

## Data

Data are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits).

Data are divided by categories, 120 type of fruits and vegetables. With 492 images per folder, between 1 and 4 folder per category, and approximately 5 Ko per image, thereâ€™s more than 300 Mo of data to store.
